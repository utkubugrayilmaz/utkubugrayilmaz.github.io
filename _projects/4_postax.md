PostaX is a comprehensive graduation project designed to revolutionize traditional mail delivery security. [cite_start]It is an intelligent mailbox system that combines Embedded Systems with Machine Learning to detect anomalies and unauthorized access attempts[cite: 32, 34].

### System Overview

The project addresses physical security challenges by implementing a smart locking mechanism controlled by user behavior analysis algorithms. [cite_start]The system creates security profiles to identify suspicious activities and trigger alerts[cite: 35].

### Hardware Architecture

[cite_start]The solution features a robust Master-Slave architecture to solve integration challenges[cite: 40]:

* [cite_start]**Core Units:** Integrated **Arduino BLE33 Rev2** and **ESP32CAM** for processing and visual verification[cite: 36, 37].
* [cite_start]**Security Mechanisms:** Utilized **RFID authentication** and **Solenoid locks** for physical security[cite: 37].
* [cite_start]**Energy Efficiency:** Designed a motion detection system that activates camera recording only when necessary, optimizing power consumption[cite: 38].
* [cite_start]**Resilience:** Implemented backup power systems and recovery code protocols to maintain functionality during power or internet outages[cite: 39].

### Software & AI Integration

* [cite_start]**Anomaly Detection:** Machine learning algorithms analyze access patterns to detect potential security breaches[cite: 34].
* [cite_start]**Remote Management:** Integrated a chatbot system for instant notifications and remote control capabilities[cite: 42].
* [cite_start]**Testing Framework:** Developed a complete testing suite to validate system performance across multiple security scenarios[cite: 41].

### Tech Stack

* [cite_start]**Hardware:** Arduino, ESP32, RFID, Solenoid Mechanisms, Servo Motors[cite: 43].
* [cite_start]**AI/ML:** Anomaly Detection Algorithms, Computer Vision[cite: 43].
* **Connectivity:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Wi-Fi.
