Developed during a software engineering internship, this project focuses on Computer Vision and Deep Learning to analyze human emotions in real-time. The system integrates facial recognition with emotion classification to create an automated attendance and monitoring solution.

### Technical Approach

The core of the system relies on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to process video feeds:

* **Custom CNN Architecture:** Designed and trained a custom CNN model to classify emotions (Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral) with high precision.
* **Performance:** Achieved **87% accuracy** in real-time testing environments.
* **Face Verification:** Utilized **DeepFace** and **OpenCV** for robust face detection and alignment before emotion analysis.

### System Features

* **Real-Time Processing:** Capable of processing video streams with low latency for immediate feedback.
* **Automated Attendance:** Replaced manual tracking methods by identifying registered users and logging their entry times automatically.
* **Interactive GUI:** Built a user-friendly interface using **Tkinter** to visualize detection results and manage user data.

### Tech Stack

* **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras, DeepFace
* **Computer Vision:** OpenCV
* **Language:** Python
* **Interface:** Tkinter
