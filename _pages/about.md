I am a **Computer Engineer** and **Artificial Intelligence Engineer** based in Ankara. I graduated from **Giresun University** (GPA: 3.26/4) with a focus on building intelligent systems that bridge software and real-world applications.

My engineering philosophy is simple: **"Build scalable, intelligent solutions."** I specialize in **Machine Learning**, **Backend Development**, and **Embedded Systems**. I don't just train models; I deploy them into production using modern tech stacks like **FastAPI**, **Docker**, and **PostgreSQL**.

### Professional Experience

**Freelance Machine Learning & Backend Engineer** (FinTech Project)
I architected and developed a comprehensive financial analysis system for a startup project targeting **BIST100 stocks**. This was an end-to-end development role where I delivered:
* **High-Performance ML Models:** Achieved **~0.67 Weighted F1-Score** and **0.97 Sharpe Ratio** in backtests using LightGBM.
* **LLM Integration:** Implemented **DeepSeek LLM** for automated multilingual news summarization and sentiment analysis.
* **Scalable Backend:** Built a robust API infrastructure using **FastAPI** and **Docker** to serve real-time trading predictions.

Previously, at **MAN Türkiye A.Ş**, I gained experience in the automotive industry, working on **AUTOSAR** stacks and R&D backend systems.

### Technical Stack

* **AI & Data Science:** Python, TensorFlow, LightGBM, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, Pandas.
* **Backend & DevOps:** FastAPI, REST APIs, Docker, Git, PostgreSQL.
* **Hardware/IoT:** Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, Sensor Integration.

I am currently open to collaboration opportunities in **AI** and **Backend Engineering**.
