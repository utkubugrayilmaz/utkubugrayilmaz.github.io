I am a **Computer Engineer** based in Ankara, passionate about bridging the gap between theoretical AI and production-grade software. I graduated from **Giresun University** (GPA: 3.26/4.00) with a strong foundation in building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.

My engineering philosophy is simple: **“Build scalable, intelligent solutions.”**

I specialize in **Machine Learning**, **Backend Development**, and **Embedded Systems**. I don’t just train models; I architect the entire lifecycle—from data engineering to deploying scalable APIs using **FastAPI**, **Docker**, and **PostgreSQL**.

### Professional Journey

My experience spans from the automotive industry to high-frequency FinTech applications.
* **In FinTech:** I architected an end-to-end financial analysis system for **BIST100** stocks. By leveraging ensemble learning techniques (LightGBM, XGBoost) and integrating LLMs (DeepSeek) for sentiment analysis, I delivered a system achieving a **~0.67 Weighted F1-Score**, a **0.97 Sharpe Ratio**, and **~230% cumulative returns in backtests**.
* **In Computer Vision:** I developed a real-time **Face Emotion Recognition** system using custom **CNN architectures** and TensorFlow. The model achieved **87% accuracy** in classifying emotions and was integrated into an automated attendance tracking system.
* **In Automotive:** At **MAN Türkiye A.Ş**, I gained valuable experience in **R&D**, working with **AUTOSAR** stacks and optimizing backend systems for embedded environments.
* **In Research:** I have actively contributed to academic research in **Steganography** and **Metaheuristic Algorithms**, developing novel methods for data security.

### Technical Arsenal

* **AI & Data Science:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, (LightGBM, XGBoost etc..), Scikit-learn, OpenCV, Pandas, NLP, CNN
* **Backend & DevOps:** FastAPI, REST APIs, Docker, Git, PostgreSQL, SQL, MLOps.
* **Hardware/IoT:** Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, Sensor Integration, Embedded C.

I am currently open to collaboration opportunities in **AI** and **Backend Engineering**.
